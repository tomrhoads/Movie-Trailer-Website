INTRODUCTION
------------

The Fresh Tomatoes web page is meant to display my favorite movies' trailers, posters, name, and storyline.
It is a pretty simple page, but it gets the job done.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

All that is required to run this page is the ability to download the folder and a web browser to display
the content.

INSTALLATION
------------

No installation is necessary as long as you have a web browser installed already.  Download the folder and 
open the fresh_tomatoes.html file and the web page will display.

If you would like to compile from the Python source code files, download Python from this link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/, and make sure to pick the version that works with your operating system.
Once downloaded you will be able to compile and edit through IDLE.

To run from the command prompt, change the directory by typing cd, then space, then the path of the folder.  
In this case it would be the path you put the folder 'movies' in. After you have successfully changed the directory,
type 'python entertainment_center.py'. This will open up the webpage.     

CONFIGURATION
-------------

There is nothing modifiable about this web page.
